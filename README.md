### This first mini project is use Gaussian Mixture Model as a Generative Model
- I always find interesting for generative models, and from the definition of GMM, its trying to learn `p(x)`. So we can actually sample from the model to generate result from the probability of `p(x)`. And in the mini project, I show its actually worked.
