# This is a repository for funny machine learning staff

### This first mini project is use Gaussian Mixture Model as a Generative Model
- I always find interesting for generative models, and from the definition of GMM, its trying to learn `p(x)`. So we can actually sample from the model to generate result from the probability of `p(x)`. And in the mini project, I show its actually worked.

### The second mini project is also about generative model, we choose Hidden Markov Model
- The HMM could also train with one class of digit and then sample from the model to generate a digit.
